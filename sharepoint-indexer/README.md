# SharePoint Indexer

This project implements a SharePoint indexer that uses Azure Cognitive Search to extract, split, and index large documents from a SharePoint site. Each document is divided into chunks, with vector embeddings generated for each chunk to enable granular and efficient search and retrieval.

## Prerequisites
This documentation assumes you have gone through the documentation for sharepoint indexer linked on the main README page. The two main documents you need to read are:

[Shrepoint Indexer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-howto-index-sharepoint-online)

[Index Projections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-how-to-define-index-projections?tabs=rest-create-index%2Crest-create-index-projection)

You also need to have Postman or any other tool you prefer to be able to make API calls. Also, Ensure your Azure resources and registered apps have necessary permissions to access the sharepoint data. This is done in the main sharepoint documentation.

Alternatively, you can do most of these steps from the relevant AI search resource within Azure under the "Search Management" section. With the exception of the sharepoint datasource, most of these steps should be doable using Azure's wizards, but if it isn't working you can submit these resource as JSON instead.

## Some Additional Information
My registered app is in the Quartech Lab tenant because our sharepoint site is in the Quartech Lab tenant. You need to reach out to IT regarding necessary permissions. My app is named 'quartech-copilot-sharepoint' in app registrations in Microsoft Entra ID.

## Create a Datasource
The following is the body of the request I used to create the datasource. The connection string uses the Qgpt sharepoint site quartech has setup in the Quartech Lab Tenant. Note I created the Entra ID app in the same tenant as the sharepoint site. You need to replace the ApplicationId, ApplicationSecret, and TenantId with your own.

    "container" : { "name" : "defaultSiteLibrary", "query" : null }
}
```
You may need to modify the container field of this request body depending on what collection of documents you are trying to access. For example, you may need to set `query` to `https://quartechsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/Q-gpt/Foobar` if you are trying to access a collection named Foobar under the Q-gpt site. Special characters like spaces need to be in URL-encoded form.

### Create an Index
To populate the index, we run the indexer. The indexer will make use of our skillet. The first skill that we use is the Text Split skill which chunks out our documents into smaller chunks. 

We then create embeddings using the Azure Embedding Skill, which creates embeddings for each chunk in each document. You can use any fields you want, this is just an example. The index needs to be created before the indexer or the skillset.

```
The skill creates embeddings for each chunk in each document. We store these embeddings in the 'contentVector' field. This is why we have to define a vector search profile and a vector search configuration. But notice that contentVector is a collection of (Edm.Single). But if our skill is creating embeddings for each chunk in a document, the resulting vector would be a collection of collections which would be hard to map. This is why we have to use index projections. 

After we get the result from the embedding skill, we treat each chunk as its own document and create its embedding and put it back into the same index we created here. If we didn't do this projection, we would be trying to fit a collection of embeddings in each index in the contentVector array which would not work. You need to read the define index projection document I linked above to understand this better. 

In this implementation, my parent and child index are the same. Notice the target index in the indexer configuration, its the same as the index in the projection in our skillset configuration. This means that we used one index to extract data from the sharepoint site, used the skills and created embeddings for each chunk, and stored them as indivdiual documents in the same index. But in the documentation, you will see that you can have separate parent and child indexes in instances where we want to keep the original documents and have the chunks.

## Create a Skillset
Notice that the target index name in the projection is the same as the index in the indexer. I am using two skills here. 

The first skill is the split skill which chunks out the documents into smaller chunks. 

The second skill is the embedding skill which creates embeddings for each chunk. The embeddings are stored in the vector field. 

The index projections tell the skillset how to take the output from the embedding skill and map it back into the index. This skillset eliminates the need for any output field mappings in the indexer. 

Mappings must be done for all fields that are not the key field of the index or the parentkeyfieldname. Everything else needs to be mapped to the appropriate field. 

You might also notice the attribute parameters.projectionMode is set to skipindexingparentdocuments. This is because we are not indexing the parent documents. We are just using the parent key field to map the embeddings back to the parent document. So if we didn't set this, we would have the original documents itself plus the chunks as individual documents in the index. For example, if five documents contribute 100 chunks to the index, then the number of documents in the index is 105. The five documents created or parent fields have nulls for child fields, making them substantially different from the bulk of the documents in the index.

Depending on the content of the datasource, you may get an error back informing you that you've hit the token limit. Try lowering the `maximumPageLength` and `pageOverlapLength` fields until this is no longer an issue.

## Create an Indexer
You must reference the names of the datasource, skillset, and index created above. Output field mappings are omitted because we are projecting our embeddings back into the same index, so these mappings are in the skillset configuration.

Note that in order to correctly reference the document metadata, you may need to make use of the `metadata_spo_...` fields. The full list of accessible fields is available [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-howto-index-sharepoint-online#indexing-document-metadata).

## Checking the Indexer Status
You can use the following request to check the status of the indexer. I prefer to just go on Azure and check whether the indexer is running or not.
```
GET https://searchs-ncus-qsl-openai-001.search.windows.net/indexers/sharepoint-indexer/status?api-version=2024-05-01-preview
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: [admin key]
```
If you make changes to the indexer or the resources it relies on, these changes may not always be reflected when you run the indexer again. To ensure your changes are included, try pressing "Reset" on the indexer from within the Azure portal before pressing "Run" again.

This is the end of the sharepoint indexer documentation. The two documents linked at the beginning combined with this documentation should be enough to get you started. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the dev team and they will direct you to the right person.
